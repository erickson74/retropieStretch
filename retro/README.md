This is a handy tool to help you load roms into your running retropie container. 

All you need to do is place your roms in the roms directory and run. 
```
./roms.sh
```

The script will grab a list of emulators currently installed, ask you which emulator the rom is for and presto--- it will mount the rom in the current directory for you without having to worry about volume mounts.
